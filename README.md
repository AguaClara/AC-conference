# AC Conference
## Introduction
The AC Conference is a (virtual) gathering of students and professionals alike who are drawn together by the mission to provide safe water on tap. It will involve presentations from various functions of AguaClara, as well as breakout discussions and team building activities.The AC Conference hopes to help make the various functions of AguaClara much more cohesive, through the sharing of ideas as well as interactions between members of the various functions. Furthermore, it hopes to educate other schools or community members on the mission of AguaClara and what AguaClara has done to help bring safe water to various communities. It hopes to showcase the key technical components of AguaClara technology, as well as the implementation process of AguaClara plants, and how AguaClara plants have impacted various communities.We envision the AguaClara Conference to have multiple components including interactive activities and guest speakers from the different branches of AguaClara in an inclusive environment promoting inquiries and further unifying AguaClara as a whole. We would hope for this conference to continue to happen in years to come.
